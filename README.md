My steps for Rust

I have bad english, please doesn't kick me :D

## Create new project

In first lesson I found out that to create new project with folder and git, I should execute next command:

```sh
cargo new <project-name>
```

But to initialize new project in existing folder, I should execute:

```sh
cargo init
```
